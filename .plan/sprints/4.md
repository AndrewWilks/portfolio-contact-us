# Sprint 4 â€” Polish & CI (detailed)

Goal: finalise CI, docs, and small polish items to make the project robust and
comfortable to run and review.

Tasks

- CI

  - Add a GitHub Actions workflow that runs: `deno fmt`, `deno lint`,
    `deno check`, `deno test`.
  - Optionally run cspell as part of CI.

- Docs & README

  - Document how to run the server, run tests, and configure the DB for local
    dev
  - Provide example curl requests for the API (create/list/verify/delete)
  - Add docs/ directory with Getting Started (Docker Compose), API examples, CI overview
  - Replace top-level README with a concise project overview and Docker quickstart

- Docker & Run

  - Add Dockerfiles for api and web; add docker-compose.yml to run both
  - Keep setup simple for reviewers (dev-friendly compose)

- Observability & Stability

  - Ensure graceful shutdown logic is in place and tested (shutdownManager.ts)
  - Improve logging levels and messages where helpful

- Accessibility & UX polish

  - Small UI tweaks, ensure layouts are responsive, basic ARIA improvements

- Code hygiene
  - Remove or resolve all TODO comments
  - Remove unused files and empty directories

Acceptance criteria

- CI runs and passes on PRs/branches
- README provides clear run/test instructions and examples
- Docker Compose can run the app locally (api + web)
- No obvious runtime crashes on normal flows; graceful shutdown works

Out of scope / next sprint (optional)

- Sprint 5: Add a simple /me page to showcase profile
