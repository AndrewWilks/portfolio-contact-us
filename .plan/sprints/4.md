# Sprint 4 â€” Polish & CI (detailed)

Goal: finalise CI, docs, and small polish items to make the project robust and
comfortable to run and review.

Tasks

- CI

  - Add a GitHub Actions workflow that runs: `deno fmt`, `deno lint`, `deno check`, `deno test`.
  - Optionally run cspell as part of CI.

- Docs & README

  - Document how to run the server, run tests, and configure the DB for local dev
  - Provide example curl requests for the API (create/list/verify/delete)

- Observability & Stability

  - Ensure graceful shutdown logic is in place and tested (shutdownManager.ts)
  - Improve logging levels and messages where helpful

- Accessibility & UX polish
  - Small UI tweaks, ensure layouts are responsive, basic ARIA improvements

Acceptance criteria

- CI runs and passes on PRs/branches
- README provides clear run/test instructions and examples
- No obvious runtime crashes on normal flows; graceful shutdown works
