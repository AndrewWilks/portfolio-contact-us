# Sprint 3 — Frontend (detailed)

Goal: provide a minimal, accessible UI for submitting contacts and viewing the
admin list for verify/delete actions.

Tasks

- Contact Us page

  - Form fields: firstName, lastName, email, phone (optional), message (optional)
  - Client-side validation using the shared Zod `ContactCreate` schema
  - Submit to `POST /api/contacts`, show friendly errors from server envelope
  - Redirect to a Thank You page on success

- Admin Contacts page

  - List contacts from `GET /api/contacts` with simple search and verified filter
  - Buttons to verify (PATCH) and delete (DELETE) each contact
  - Optimistic UI updates acceptable, but confirm deletions

- Tests
  - Lightweight smoke tests (manual or automated) to verify the end-to-end flow

Acceptance criteria

- The UI uses shared validation rules (Zod) so client/server agree on shapes.
- Manual end-to-end flow works locally (submit → visible in admin list).
- Styles are responsive and accessible (basic keyboard focus and ARIA labels).
