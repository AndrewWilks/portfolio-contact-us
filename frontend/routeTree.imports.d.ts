// (intentionally left blank)
// Do not add ambient module declarations here. Deno TypeScript does not
// allow relative module names in `declare module` and it causes `deno check`
// to fail. The generated `routeTree.gen.ts` is ts-nocheck'ed and excluded
// from linting, and the production build is handled by Vite.
