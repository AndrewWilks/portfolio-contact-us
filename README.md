# Portfolio Contact Flow, Deno, Hono, Vite, React

A small full stack app for a contact flow, a public Contact page that submits to
an API, a Thank You page, and a simple Contacts list. Runtime is Deno v2, server
is Hono, client is Vite + React, persistence will use Drizzle ORM with libSQL.

## Stack

- Runtime, Deno v2
- API, Hono
- Web, Vite + React
- ORM, Drizzle ORM, libSQL client
- Testing, Deno test for API, Vitest for UI
- Config, `.config` holds Vite, ESLint, tsconfigs, cspell
- Tasks and imports live in `deno.json`, see scripts below,
  :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

## Dev setup

```bash
cp .env.example .env

# terminal 1, run both
deno task dev

# or, separate
deno task dev:api
deno task dev:vite
```

- Web app on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- API on [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
- The web app calls the API via the Vite proxy, fetch to `/api/...` inside the
  frontend, no absolute host strings needed

## Vite proxy

Vite proxies `/api` to the backend during `dev`, so the browser talks to the
same origin, CORS stays quiet, and frontend code can use `fetch("/api/hello")`.
If you change the backend port, update `.config/vite.config.ts` to match. For
production, serve the frontend behind a reverse proxy that forwards `/api` to
the Hono server, or configure the frontend build output to the same origin as
the API.

## Environment

`.env.example` provides:

```properties
API_PORT=8000
API_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000
VITE_API_URL=/api
VITE_APP_ENV=development
```

`VITE_API_URL` uses `/api` by default to align with the proxy, you can swap it
later if you deploy the UI and API on different origins.

## Scripts

From `deno.json`:

- `dev`, run API and Vite together
- `dev:api`, run the Hono server with env and net permissions
- `dev:vite`, run Vite with the shared config

You can inspect or tweak these in `deno.json`, the imports map also pins
versions,

## API, quick smoke

- `GET /api/health`, returns `{ ok: true }`
- `GET /api/hello`, returns `{ message: "Hello from Deno + Hono" }`

Use these to confirm the proxy and server are working.

```

## Development plan

See `.plan/specs/plan.md` for phased work, setup, and issue sequencing.

### Phase 0 Goals (Bootstrap)

- Implement API hello routes (`/api/health`, `/api/hello`)
- Create basic Vite app home page that fetches `/api/hello`
- Set up basic tests (Deno for API, Vitest for UI)
- Ensure central configs (lint, format, build) work
- Demonstrate Tailwind CSS integration in UI

## Conventions

- Zod will define request and form schemas, shared where practical
- Drizzle schema mirrors Zod types for persistence
- Error responses follow `{ ok, data, error }`
- `.gitkeep` files ensure empty folders are tracked
- cspell runs with `.config/cspell.json` to keep spelling tidy

## Troubleshooting

- If the UI shows ‚Äúcould not reach API‚Äù, check the API terminal logs, confirm
  `API_PORT` and the Vite proxy target match
- If CORS appears in logs, verify `API_ORIGINS` includes the Vite dev origin,
  usually `http://localhost:3000`

## Developer notes

- A fast backend unit test was added to validate the `/hello` contract without
  starting a network server. The test imports the Hono app and calls the handler
  directly. File: `backend/__tests__/hello.test.ts`.

- The server startup in `backend/server.ts` is guarded so tests can import the
  app safely without opening network sockets:

```ts
if (import.meta.main) {
  // start server here
}
```

- Run the new backend unit test locally (CI uses the same command):

```bash
deno test --allow-env --env-file=./.env backend/__tests__/hello.test.ts --no-check
```

These notes are part of Phase 0 developer guidance and keep the test workflow
fast and deterministic for CI.

## Testing with a temporary database (recommended)

The repository uses a SQLite (libSQL) file for local development and tests. To run the backend unit tests locally against a temporary database, follow these steps.

1. Create a `.env.test` file at the repository root with a temporary DB path and minimal env vars:

```properties
# .env.test
DB_FILE_NAME=sqlite:./tmp/test.sqlite
NODE_ENV=test
BACKEND_PORT=8001
```

2. Ensure the DB schema exists. If you use Drizzle migrations, run the migration push against the test env:

```powershell
deno task db:push --env-file ./.env.test
```

If you don't have migrations ready, you can create the DB folder and an empty sqlite file before running tests:

```powershell
mkdir .\tmp -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
New-Item -Path .\tmp\test.sqlite -ItemType File -Force
```

3. Run the tests (backend-only example):

```powershell
deno test --allow-all --env-file ./.env.test backend/__tests__/repos --no-check
```

Notes:

- `--allow-all` is used in tests to allow file I/O and temporary DB access. For CI you may tighten permissions as needed.
- The tests expect the `contacts` table/schema to exist. `deno task db:push` uses `drizzle-kit` and `.config/drizzle.config.ts` to apply migrations when available.
- Using a dedicated `DB_FILE_NAME` for tests keeps your local development DB separate and prevents accidental data loss.
